\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Recent research show that the performance of Information Retrieval Systems drops overtime as data becomes more temporarily distant from the training data. This means that as time goes on and the content of Web documents and also of users search preferences evolve, these models tend to produce poor results.
We aim to create a system that mitigates this problem by using the training data provided by Qwant search engine, containing user searches and web documents in both French and English.

The paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:methodology} describes our approach; Section~\ref{sec:setup} explains our experimental setup; Section~\ref{sec:results} discusses our main findings; finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} draws some conclusions and outlooks for future work.
